# A Brief Introduction to Machine Learning in the Context of Robotic Applications

## Using Pre-trained Models: a walkthrough
- Initialise key variables
- Load model
- Carry out basic image classification task

## Using Pre-trained Models on Our Own Data
- Developing/gathering a dataset: basic shapes blue/orange circles/rectangles used for example to give commands to the robot such as "go/stop/turn right"
- Retrain model: what are important considerations here given that we are using pre-trained models? 
- Carry out image classification for robotic applications - think about what output would be best for the model to give: what is the application, navigation/identification/surveying?
- How generalisable is ML - can we use similar techniques to detect sounds etc?

## ML applications
- Image classification: navigate the robot to different viewpoints, "scan" the area, and record any important phenomena
- Image classification: navigate a busy factory with "no-go" zones successfully, to bring items from one side to the other
- Sound classification: navigate a dangerous area (different hazards give off different noises) without damaging the robot
